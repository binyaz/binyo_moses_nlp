# Sentiment Classification for Amazon tweets

Our goal for this project is to apply Natural Language Processing techniques on a collection of tweets centered around Amazon Web Services. In doing so, one would be able to classify the sentiment of such tweets based on linguistic elements in order to gain various business insights such as main competitors, favorable features, and potential employees in the field.

# Data Resource

Data was collected from https://data.world/jacobfacer/twitter/workspace/file?filename=Twitter%2Bdata%2Bin%2Bsheets.xlsx, with very little contextual information provided with the data.

twitter.ipynb is the NLP EDA code
twitterdata.xlsx is the dataset
Untitled.ipynb is the modeling code
